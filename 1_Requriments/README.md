# Introduction
  In modern computing and digital electronics, the most commonly used bases are decimal (base 10), binary (base 2), octal (base 8), and hexadecimal (base 16).
* A number can be represented with different base values. We are familiar with the numbers in the base 10 (known as decimal numbers), with digits taking values 0,1,2,…,8,9.

*  A computer uses a Binary number system which has a base 2 and digits can have only TWO values: 0 and 1.
   A decimal number with a few digits can be expressed in binary form using a large number of digits. Thus the number 65 can be expressed in binary form as 1000001.

*  The binary form can be expressed more compactly by grouping 3 binary digits together to form an octal number. An octal number with base 8 makes use of the EIGHT digits
   0,1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7.

*  A more compact representation is used by Hexadecimal representation which groups 4 binary digits together. It can make use of 16 digits, but since we have only 10 digits, the
   remaining 6 digits are made up of first 6 letters of the alphabet. Thus the hexadecimal base uses 0,1,2,….8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F as digits. 


# To summarize:
* Decimal : base 10
* Binary : base 2
* Octal: base 8
* Hexadecimal : base 16

 This project is developed using concept C programming in which will perform basic operations converting number from one base value to other like  
* hexadecimal to Decimal
* Binary to Decimal 
* Octal to Decimal 
* Decimal to Binary
* Decimal to Octal
* Decimal to Hexadecimal
* Binary to Hexadecimal
* Binary to Octal
* Octal to Binary
* Hexdecimal to Binary 

depending on the input from the user.

# Objective:
The main aim of the project are:
 * To perform the operations converting number from one base value to other value selected  by the user.
 * Output the same result if the entered choice meets the requirement.
